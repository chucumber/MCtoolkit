                    Walk of Shame (WOS)
                </summary>
                is an artist collective based in Bergen, Norway, working at the intersection of visual art, performance,
                and social space. Their practice explores participation, community, and the aesthetics of excess, often
                creating immersive environments that blur the boundaries between audience and performer. With a playful
                yet critical approach, WOS stages works that challenge conventions of taste, behavior, and collectivity,
                inviting participants into transformative and unpredictable experiences.

                What does it mean to turn an educational space into a site of experimentation, care, and shared
                responsibility? The collective Walk of Shame invite us behind the scenes of their guest-curated autumn
                semester for Mobilizing Citizenship 2022, where education was reimagined as a space for embodied
                learning and mutual support. Through a series of collaborative workshops, they explored how caring and
                sharing can move beyond abstract ideals to become lived, daily practices. In this reflective overview,
                Walk of Shame share their approach to crafting environments that nurture agency, spark dialogue, and
                foster collective creativity.

            <div class="content">
                <b>Walk of Shame</b> is a Bergen-based artist collective that has, since 2012, explored the unruly
                beauty of
                co-creation through performance, installation, and participatory art. At the heart of our practice lies
                a fascination with shared authorship, agency, and the creative potential that emerges when control is
                deliberately relinquished. Our work often unfolds within fictional frameworks that invite
                collaborators—especially young participants—into immersive acts of making, imagining, and becoming.
                <br>
                <br>
                Rather than steering toward fixed outcomes, we cultivate what we call positive chaos: a fluid terrain
                where leadership shifts, care circulates, and expression takes unexpected forms. It is within this
                instability that we find fertile ground for relational learning and the blurring of boundaries between
                the artistic and the social.
                <br>
                <br>
                When we were invited to join the Mobilizing Citizenship project, our intention was not to instruct, but
                to set the conditions for collective experimentation. Drawing on participatory and relational art
                practices, we approached care and sharing not as lofty ideals, but as intimate, embodied gestures. We
                knew from experience that in these processes, it is often the journey—not the end result—that carries
                the deepest resonance. Here, we take you into how we worked to create a setting where young voices could
                surface, collide, and converge—giving rise to new expressions of identity, presence, and protest.

                        Walk of Shame participated in MC twice. First with a workshop in the spring of 2019 under
                        the
                        semester theme of Movement and Body Representation. In the summer of 2020 Walk of Shame was
                        invited
                        to
                        hold workshops as part of Kunsthall Stavanger summer school Klikk Her-TV. They later guest
                        curated
                        the
                        MC autumn semester of 2022 consisting of four workshops, one of them was held at the MUNCH
                        museum in
                        Oslo. This text looks more closely at the autumn semester of 2022.

                    <h3>How it began: Setting the stage and creating a foundation for openness</h3>
                    From the very first session with the participants in the beginning of autumn 2022, we focused on
                    building a safer space, not through declarations, but through atmosphere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The central theme we worked with was “Sharing is caring // Caring is sharing”. This was more than a
                    slogan, it shaped the entire space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We welcomed participants aged 12 to 16 with music, snacks and soft lighting. A small fictional
                    campfire
                    had been set up in the middle of the room, creating a warm and intimate focus point. Around it, we
                    placed conversational objects, including a model of a human cell and one of an animal cell.
                    Together, we
                    compared them. This sparked unexpected questions: What makes us human? How do humans and animals
                    share?
                    Can you share something without words?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From here we asked all participants to choose a name for the day and to make their own hand-drawn
                    name
                    tags. While seated together in a circle on the floor, we undertook activities, such as drawing
                    games,
                    sharing music and telling short, funny or awkward stories. These low-threshold rituals became the
                    foundation for openness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the center of our circle, we placed a large sheet of paper with the phrase written boldly across
                    it.
                    We asked: What does this mean to me? To us? Participants responded by adding small drawings, short
                    texts
                    and symbols, turning personal reflections into something visible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After some time, we rotated seats around the circle. Each participant now sat in front of someone
                    else’s
                    contribution and was invited to build on it. They could respond, extend or question what was already
                    there. This silent, thoughtful exchange turned into a collective artwork, layered with meaning. In a
                    way, everyone had thought someone else’s thoughts and had to engage with them. The space between us
                    had
                    changed. We were no longer just individuals. We had become a shared "we."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Becoming Part of Something Bigger, Across Time</h4>
                    Becoming Part of Something Bigger, Across Time
                    As the workshops unfolded, a new chapter opened.,A woman from the 1950s entered the room,
                    transported
                    through time, or so it seemed. One of us from Walk of Shame had taken on the role of a character
                    from
                    another era. She wasn’t humorous, but rather magical and quiet. In a soft, measured voice, she spoke
                    of
                    wonder and memory – how people shared when she was young.
                    She described emotions exchanged through handwritten letters, food and stories offered without
                    screens,
                    and the presence of silence as something meaningful, even weighty The participants were invited to
                    ask
                    her anything, and they did:
                    <br>
                    “Did people talk about feelings in the 50s?”
                    <br>
                    “How did you protest if something felt unfair?”
                    <br>
                    “What was friendship like before phones?”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her answers were poetic, sometimes strange and always rich with detail. And with her presence, the
                    room
                    shifted. Time folded in on itself. he group began comparing their own ways of sharing with something
                    imagined, yet emotionally real. The fictional frame made it easier to ask deeper questions. How has
                    sharing changed? What do we miss? What do we carry forward? This fictional frame allowed for
                    reflection
                    without judgement. It created an opening for empathy across generations, technologies and lived
                    experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This process allowed participants to change pace and leave behind the roles they might carry at
                    school
                    or home. They entered a different kind of space, one that didn’t ask them to perform, but to be
                    present.
                    Slowly, through drawing, storytelling, shared music and intentional silences, we built a sense of
                    community. Trust did not arrive through declarations, but through a quiet, steady invitation: to
                    slow
                    down, to listen, and to become part of something bigger—together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Making Identity Visible: Jackets, Patches, and Secrets</h4>
                    Across the four-part workshop series, each participant received a denim jacket to personalize—an
                    invitation to make identity visible, tactile, and wearable. Inspired by subcultural movements such
                    as
                    the punk and goth scene, participants designed logos, invented characters and imagined what those
                    characters would stand for. One of the key activities, Button Secrets, invited everyone to
                    anonymously
                    write a small secret, draw someone else's at random, and transform it into a button. Other
                    collaborative
                    exercises included a group mega-drawing and adding elements from each other’s jackets, creating an
                    evolving visual conversation between participants.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over time, the jackets transformed into wearable statements of presence and protest. Secrets became
                    buttons, fears became patches, and imagined characters found real voices. Through material play and
                    personal storytelling, the group co-created meaning not only through what they made, but through the
                    attention and care they offered each other. One participant painted a symbol of care that was later
                    mirrored by others. Another wrote, “I’m scared too,” not as a confession, but as an invitation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Expanding the Space: From Inside to Outside</h4>
                    After building a strong group dynamic, we began preparing to move into public space – an intentional
                    and
                    essential part of the process. In a dimly lit room, we lay on the floor with eyes closed, music
                    playing.
                    articipants were invited to revisit what they had made, seen and felt. Then gathered in a circle we
                    asked: What surprised you? What would you want others to know about us?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From this space of reflection, we transitioned into a silent walk through the city, a subtle and
                    poetic
                    demonstration. Participants wore their personalised jackets, face paint and masks. They carried
                    handmade
                    stickers featuring their own messages: small but powerful signs that were placed in public space.
                    Some
                    were stuck to walls and lamp posts, with messages like:
                    <br>
                    “You are not alone”
                    <br>
                    “I’m listening”
                    <br>
                    “You don’t need to be perfect to matter.”
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    These were messages to the world – but also gestures of care and connection. The group claimed
                    public
                    space not with noise, but through intention, by taking up space together with care.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We encouraged participants to reimagine public space – not only as a site of risk, but as a place of
                    possibility. The silent walk became a collective act of embodied presence, where each person claimed
                    visibility on their own terms: quietly, creatively and with courage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Institutional Echoes: Between Stavanger and Oslo</h4>
                    Our workshops unfolded in two places:Kunsthall Stavanger and the Munch Museum in Oslo. The shift
                    between
                    the two locations was revealing. In Stavanger, the young participants felt at ease. They laughed,
                    debated and claimed space with confidence. In Oslo, the tone changed. Voices lowere and their
                    movements
                    became tentative. One participant asked quietly: “Are we allowed to be here?”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We hadn’t planned for this shift, but we felt it. It serves as a powerful reminder that space is
                    never
                    neutral. Institutions carry expectations – both spoken and unspoken – that shape how we behave and
                    who
                    feels entitled to speak.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And yet, the participants embraced the moment. Their gestures, though subtle,, were intentional: A
                    patch
                    with five symbols of care; a button echoing someone else’s voice; a costume that allowed them to
                    become
                    someone else for an afternoon. Through these small acts they performed visibility, solidarity and
                    agency.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Final Circle: Co-curation and Reflection</h4>
                    At the end of the series, we returned to the circle. ackets, drawings, stickers and memories were
                    laid
                    out before us. We asked: What stayed with you? What did you learn from someone else?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Participants were invited to curate a final exhibition based not on what looked best, but on what
                    mattered most to them. The result was anything but a polished display of outcomes. Instead if became
                    a
                    gathering of lived processes. Visitors encountered objects, but also traces of conversations, care
                    and
                    collective authorship. It stood as a living archive of what had been shared – a soft protest against
                    the
                    idea that young voices must be polished to be worthy of attention.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before our reflection, we read a short excerpt from a report on the Norwegian freedom of speech. We

                    it together and it served as a spark for conversation. What does freedom of expression mean to you?
                    Do
                    you feel free to speak — at school, at home, in public?

                    <br>
                    The answers were thoughtful, sometimes hesitant, but always rooted in lived experience. Reading the
                    report together added gravity to the conversation. It became clear that freedom is not only about
                    legal
                    rights it is also about space, trust and being recognised.

                    <h4>What We Learned About Art, Voice, and Space</h4>
                    In a world where young voices are often drowned out by the noise of everyday life, creating
                    statements
                    on jackets, buttons and stickers became an effective way to make ourselves seen and heard. By
                    wearing
                    our beliefs and opinions on our sleeves – litterally – we were making a statement about who we are
                    and
                    what we stand for. These acts weren’t just personal, they invited connections with other people who
                    shared our values. They created openings to meet others who shared our values, and also those who
                    offered different perspectives.(?)

                    <br>

                    earing someone else’s words or symbols became an act of solidarity,amplifying voices beyond our own.
                    In
                    doing so, we formed small intentional communities rooted not only in shared interest, but in mutual
                    curiosity and care. These were not echo chambers, but spaces of exchange: where learning about each
                    other mattered.
                    <br>
                    also.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through the workshops, we witnessed how a creative process can offer young people space to be heard
                    –
                    without pressure to perform or conform. Small gestures — choosing a name, drawing a fear, wearing a
                    secret — sparked profound connections. We experienced how public space can be transformed through
                    quiet
                    presence, and how institutions influence who feels entitled to take up space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most of all, we reaffirmed our belief that art is not something to observe from a distance. It is
                    something we do together. It can be activism. It can bea language for expressing the personal and
                    politica It can be a language for making room for difference, for care, and for voice.

                    <br>
                    As one participant put it:
                    <br>
                    “Here, I can breathe differently.”
